# My React-Redux App

- I am using Vite to setup my project with Bun as a package manager because I find it much faster when I need to install new dependencies and the runtime has been proved to be quicker than the NodeJS
- In my app, I am using Redux Toolkit with the Redux Thunk middleware and Axios for getting products from the API and post new products onto the API
- Additionally, I am using Bootstrap for demo purposes because it has functional components that can be used quickly to demonstrate the workflow of displaying posts and creating a form that is similar to real-world product and post it to the API. Firstly, I thought that I was making a mistake as the code is properly working but it still cannot display the new product to the listing page. So I tried to test the API by using Postman and manual testing in Redux Toolkit and it worked really well. So I looked up on the documentation of the API and they said that the CRUD operations with the API is just for testing and demo only. 
- Thank you for looking at my code and I am sorry if my code feels pretty heavy or not too pretty looking!
